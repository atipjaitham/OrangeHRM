# OrangeHRM Testing Project

This project aims to enhance my skills in manual testing and automation testing using Cypress.

## Overview
I will be dividing the project timeline into 5 days as follows:

- **Days 1-3**: Manual Testing
  - I will create test cases and perform manual testing on the following sections of the website [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/):
    1. Login Page
    2. Employee Management
    3. User Management
  
  During this period, I will provide daily updates on my progress using Google Sheets: [Daily Progress Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YxN_X6JDM55k5ZXmVaFoK4mQPrG93oSRKqtHK0cI_RI/edit?usp=sharing)

- **Day 4**: Automation Testing
  - I will automate the tests by writing code in JavaScript using Cypress.

- **Day 5**: Custom Commands Implementation
  - All the code will be refactored to use custom commands for easier maintenance and future code reviews.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Manual Testing**: No specific tools required.
- **Automation Testing**: Cypress, JavaScript.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run Cypress: `npm run cypress:open` or `npm run cypress:run`.

## Usage
- To run manual tests, navigate to the respective sections of the OrangeHRM Demo website and execute the test cases.
- To run automated tests, use Cypress by executing the appropriate npm command.
