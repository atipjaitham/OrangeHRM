# OrangeHRM Testing Project 🍊

This project aims to enhance my skills in manual testing and automation testing using Cypress.
- Start Date : 14 May 2024 🚀

## Overview
I will be dividing the project timeline for phrase 1 as follows:

- Manual Testing (DONE) ✅
  - I will create test cases and perform manual testing on the following sections of the website [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/):
    1. Login Page ✅
    2. Employee Management ✅
    3. User Management ✅
  
  During this period, I will provide daily updates on my progress using Google Sheets
- [TEST CASE 📝 ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YxN_X6JDM55k5ZXmVaFoK4mQPrG93oSRKqtHK0cI_RI/edit?usp=sharing)
- [BUG REPORT 🚨](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116LKCIVRZK6iJshkJKkq6l5yru-18YFW7mTAyEI8L-k/edit?usp=sharing)

- Automation Testing (DOING) ✍️
  - I will automate the tests by writing code in JavaScript using Cypress. ✍️
    1. Login Page ✅
    2. Employee Management ⏳
    3. User Management 

- Custom Commands Implementation
  - All the code will be refactored to use custom commands for easier maintenance and future code reviews.
